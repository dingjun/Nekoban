# Nekoban
Nekoban is a Sokoban-like game implemented with Cocos2d-x. Player has to push all boxes to the goal positions with as less steps as possible. This game utilizes [factory pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) to create various units, [component pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) to abstract different behaviors of unit, and [command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) for undo functionality.
